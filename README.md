# 🪨 Underground

**Buried alive. Survive the deep. Thrive in the stone.**

**Underground** is a survival overhaul mod that flips the Minecraft world on its head—literally. Say goodbye to the surface. In this mod, players spawn deep underground, entombed in layers of stone, and must adapt to a world without sunlight, trees, or the safety of the open sky.

## Features

### ☣️ Radioactive Oceans
- Oceans now contain **Radioactive Water**.
- Exposure gives players **Radiation Poisoning**, a new harmful effect.
- Adds an extra layer of challenge to underwater exploration and travel.
